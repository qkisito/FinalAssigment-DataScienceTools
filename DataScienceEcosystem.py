# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# In this notebook, will be present the Data Science Tools and Ecosystem learned in the course.

# **Objectives:**
# - List popular programming languages used in Data Science.
# - List libraries used in Data Science.
# - Name development environment open souce tools used in Data Science.
# - Make arithmetic expression in Python.

# In Data Science, you could use a lot of programming languages, such as:
# 1) Python.
# 2) R.
# 3) Julia.
# 4) Java.
# 5) Stata.

# Furthermore, there are useful library that could provide you multiple functions, like:
# 1) NumPy.
# 2) Matplotlib.
# 3) Pandas.
# 4) ScikitLearn.
# 5) GGPlot.

# |Data Science Tools|
# |------------------|
# |Anaconda|
# |VSCode|
# |RStudio|

# ### On the other hand, these are some example of arithmetic expressions in Python:

# In[1]:


#Here is presented a simple arithmetic expression, where is multiplied and added integer numbers.
(3*4)+5


# In[3]:


#This is an example that explain how to convert minutes to hours, just diving the number of minutes by 60.
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
print(hours)
